\section{Techniques}

Please detail how each of the four required techniques was used in your implementation.
The required techniques are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item a purely functional data structure (queue, heap, tree, heap...),
    \item lenses and/or traversals,
    \item monad transformers OR free monads, and
    \item concurrency (e.g. for logging).
\end{enumerate}
